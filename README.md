# School_District_Analysis
## Purpose and Working with the Data
The purpose of this activity was to dig into school district data using Pandas and Jupyter.
Initially I worked with the data to make it was prepared to manipulate. We removed null values, and turned grade into a workable integer.

##Comparing Public and Charter Schools
When comparing public to charter schools, first we look at scores. The average scores for reading and math were both lower in public school. Interestingly, in charter schools the average math score was higher than public school for grades 9, 10, and 11, however public school grade 12 had higher average math scores.

When looking at budgets, the average of charter school budgets is lower than the average of public school budgets. The average of public schools budget is higher than the total average of all budgets within the data frame, whereas the average of charter school budgets was lower.

##Further Questions
I think some interesting future questions would be comparing the relationship between funding and scores overall. Between years, I think it would be interesting to see how many students transfer from public to charter schools or vice versa, and comparing the grades before and after.
